# This project contains two applications: City Information and City Selector. The City information application is responsible for handling all the city views shown to the user, except that it cannot be instantiated unless called upon by the City Selector application. The City information application will display a page that notifies the user to use the City Selector application to utilize the City information application. Once the user chooses one of two cities, Chicago or Indianapolis, through the City Selector application then a list of point of interests will be displayed to the user. The user will be able to click on a location such as Navy Pier. The City Information application will then process the command and open the web page that correlates to the given location pressed. Note: Opening the website in the emulator takes a few seconds. Overall, the point of both applications is for one to send a broadcast to the receiving application, from which operations will be handled.
